# HRBot

### Objective :dart:
In Most MNCâ€™s, Employees spend most of their time contacting HRs for minor issue clarifications such as leave balance, issues with salary, etc which is a time taking process. The time which is spent here can be utilized in other ways to increase the production of the company.


# Solution : 
To do this, we came up with a solution, by creating an AI chatbot, [Chatbot image] that reduces the time of physical connection between HR and employee. By introducing this system, it can respond to queries asked by the users which deal with the issues of the employees and sends the data to a webpage, where HR can view and deal with the respective requests. In this way, HRs can know the requests and deal with them in an appropriate way thus giving sustainable development for the company.
