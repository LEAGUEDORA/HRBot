# HRBot

### Objective :dart:
In Most MNCâ€™s, Employees spend most of their time contacting HRs for minor issue clarifications such as leave balance, issues with salary, etc which is a time taking process. The time which is spent here can be utilized in other ways to increase the production of the company.


# Solution : 
To do this, we came up with a solution, by creating an AI chatbot, [Chatbot image] that reduces the time of physical connection between HR and employee. By introducing this system, it can respond to queries asked by the users which deal with the issues of the employees and sends the data to a webpage, where HR can view and deal with the respective requests. In this way, HRs can know the requests and deal with them in an appropriate way thus giving sustainable development for the company. 

# Strategy

## Clear Explaination of Solution Approach :

### Bot Explanation:

This is an AI chatbot developed with the RASA package in python.

The bot can handle the following requests:

1.Leave Balance

2.Salary Issues

3.Harassment Issues

4.Resignation Issues

5.Payslip

6.Reimbursement


This is a user-friendly chatbot that gives responses to the user.

It does contain the security, access rights that authenticates the employees with respective username and password. If the respective details of the employee are valid then the employee can access the features of the bot.


If The employee wants to check the leave balance they can simply message the bot asking for the leave balance or any type of message which implements the request.

The bot will send the requested data from the database.

The employee can request a salary issue in the same manner where the issue will be carried to the hr web page and database.

The bot can provide a payslip for the respective employee which includes basic salary, bonus, HRA, etc.

The bot can also be used for reimbursement requests like for onsite purposes, BCP, Transfers, or employees can request for any other reimbursement by providing the project the employee is included, the total expenditure, etc.

### UI Explanation:

A separate website has been created for HR to view the messages that are carried out by the bot.

Which contains the authentication process where respective hr can log in.

After completion of the authentication, the webpage is redirected to another page where it displays every category that contains its own data which displays the issue and status of the issue whether it is solved or unsolved, and contains a button that will redirect to mails where hr can directly send the mails to respective employees.
